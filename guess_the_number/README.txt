# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game implemented in Python. The game generates a random number between 0 and 100, and the player has to guess the correct number within a certain number of attempts.

## How to Play
1. Run the script: `python your_script_name.py`.
2. You will be asked if you want to play the guessing game (Yes/No).
3. If you choose "Yes," you will need to enter a number to guess the randomly generated target number.
4. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is correct, greater, or lesser than the target.
5. You have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
6. If you guess the correct number, you win! If not, the game will end, and you can try again later.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the guessing game.

## Notes
- The game generates a random number between 0 and 100.
- You have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
- Adjust the code if you want to change the range of random numbers or the maximum number of attempts.

Feel free to modify and customize the script according to your preferences!
